                About Me
            </div>
            <div class="main-para1">
                <p>
                    I am an incoming junior transfer at University of California, Los Angeles. 
                    I am majoring in Electrical Engineering. Since childhood, I have been intrigued by circuits and mechanisms behind toys. 
                    That passion continuously pushes me to seek opportunities such as research and internships related Electrical Engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After immigrating to the United States in 2017, I decided to strengthen my writing and communication skills by
                    enrolling in English as a second language classes at Cypress College. While taking ESL classes, I got the opportunity to 
                    get involved in the STEM program, designed to bridge aspiring college students with a professional environment.
                    I value this program because it provided me a safe environment to thrive as a prospective engineer.
                    It also allowed me to develop my leadership and time management skills. I also go the opportunity to work as a 
                    group leader in the STEM program. In those meetings, I scheduled and conducted one-hour Socratic seminars about proper 
                    etiquette, networking, and college resources.

                    Aside from leadership role, I got the opportunity to conduct research at California Polytechnic State University. 
                    It was a great experience which enabled me to adapt to that challenging environment quickly utilizing my strong 
                    mathematical foundation and coding knowledge. Since I was using a newly build software library for the research, 
                    there were functionality errors along the journey. However, I was able to collaborate with my peers and resolve 
                    those errors by revising the source files of the developer. I enjoyed working in an intensive environment where 
                    I was able to exploit what I had learned throughout my courses.

                    During my free time, I like to watch anime and play percussion. I also enjoy analyzing stock market, investing, 
                    and managing my portfolio.
